This is a custome module we build in Drupal 7. In this application, a faculty can choose to use one of the following source for his public profile:
- local inforamtion (DBMI Website)
- Information from DigitalVita (external system)

Code in the import-publications.page.php page is trying to do:
For those who choose to use local information, 
- delete publication and grant information imported from DV;
- publish publication and grant information on local website (publication and grant are two Drupal content types in the application).
For those who choose to use DV information:
- import publication and grant information from DV;
- unpublish publication and grant information on local website.

This function is set to run with cron job once every night.
